        <p><em>Blueberry pancakes are a wonderful treat when fresh blueberries are in season. But don't limit your enjoyment of these tender, golden cakes to summer; frozen blueberries make them a year-round treat</em></p>

    <h2>Ingedients</h2>

        <ul>
            <li>1 3/4 cups all-purpose flour</li>
            <li>2 tbsp sugar</li>
            <li>1 tsp baking powder</li>
            <li>1/2 tsp vanilla extract</li>
            <li>1 1/2 cups fresh or frozen blueberries</li>
            <li>1/2 tsp salt</li>
            <li>2 large eggs</li>
            <li>1 cup milk, plus more if needed</li>
            <li>1 cup sour cream</li>
            <li>1 stick butter, melted</li>
            <li>1/2 tsp lemon zest</li>
        </ul>
        
    <h2>Make it!</h2>

        <ol>
            <li>Sift the flour, sugar, baking powder, baking soda and salt into a large mixing bowl. In a separate large bowl, lightly whisk the eggs. Add the milk, sour cream, half the melted butter and the vanilla, whisking to blend. Make a well in the dry ingredients and pour the egg mixture into it. Whisk the ingredients together just until blended. Fold the blueberries and lemon zest into the batter. </li>
            <li>Heat a large skillet or griddle over medium heat and coat with some of the remaining melted butter. For each pancake, pour about 1/4 cup of the batter into the hot skillet. Cook 3 or 4 pancakes at a time, depending on the size of the skillet. If the batter seems too thick, thin it with 1 to 2 tablespoons milk. When bubbles begin to form and "pop" on the pancake's surface, after about 1 minute, and the outer edge looks done, flip it over and cook briefly for about 30 seconds on the other side.</li>

        </ol>
